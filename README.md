# ðŸŽ“ TA-Lessons

Welcome to the **TA-Lessons** repository! This repository contains the lesson plans, exercises, and teaching material I've created for the **INDA** course at KTH. My focus is on fostering an interactive learning environment through group assignments, hands-on exercises, and active participation.

## ðŸ“… Course Structure

The course is broadly divided into two parts:

1. **Weeks 1â€“9: Introduction to Java Programming**
   - Foundational Java concepts
   - Object-oriented programming (OOP)
   - Debugging and code refactoring
   - Test-driven development (TDD)
   - Collaborative projects and group work

2. **Weeks 9â€“18: Data Structures and Algorithms**
   - Advanced Java programming
   - Collections, recursion, and generics
   - Algorithmic problem-solving

While the lesson structure follows this general outline, my teaching approach is flexible and adapted to the needs and progress of the students.

## ðŸ’¡ Teaching Philosophy

My lessons prioritize:
- **Interactivity:** Students engage with the material through live coding, discussions, and collaborative problem-solving.
- **Group Assignments:** Working in teams encourages communication, peer learning, and a stronger understanding of concepts.
- **Active Participation:** Learning by doingâ€”every lesson involves writing and discussing code.

Coding can be a solitary grind, but weâ€™re social creatures. These hours are about breaking that isolationâ€”discussing ideas, challenging solutions, and learning from each other. Itâ€™s often in conversation that concepts truly stick and understanding deepens.
